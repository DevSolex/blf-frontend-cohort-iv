                    Lambda is a deep tech venture studio within <a href="">Ergodic Group</a>, a holding company <br> focused on long-term technology bets. We identify hard problems worth solving <br> and build advanced systems to solve them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team brings deep expertise across cryptography, distributed systems, com <br>pilers, machine learning, high-frequency trading, real-time bidding, aero <br>space, biotech, gaming, and embedded devices. This domain knowledge—knowing <br>what to build and why—is our foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work where research meets production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2014 in Buenos Aires, <mark>Argentina,</mark> Lambda has expanded to Montevideo <br>(Uruguay), Madrid and Barcelona (Spain), and Paris (France). We hire in all <br>locations.

                    What we do
                </h4>
                <h5>
                    Technical Judgment at Scale 
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In a world where code is increasingly automated, the scarce resource is judg <br>ment: knowing which problems matter, which architectures will hold, and which <br>tradeoffs are worth making. Lambda exists to apply deep technical judgment to <br>complex challenges.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Our Engagement Model 
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We don't work hourly. We don't do staff augmentation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We establish shared goals with our partners and work independently, employing <br>our methodology to achieve results. When you partner with Lambda, you're not <br>hiring developers—you're engaging a team that will own the problem end-to-end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ensure fluid communication and full accountability. But we work our way. <br>We've spent a decade learning how. 
                </p>

                    Our values

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>No bullshit:</strong> We prioritize results over rhetoric, substance over ceremony. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Integrity:</strong> We embrace openness and truthfulness. Honesty is the corner <br>stone of a strong community. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Open source:</strong> We believe in shared knowledge and collaboration. Our work is <br>public by default. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Less is more:</strong> Do the simplest thing that could work. Stay agile, stay ef <br>fective. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fail fast:</strong> Setbacks are learning experiences. We embrace growth through <br>failure. 
                        </li>

                    Work with us
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We believe in transparency: both our selection process and the foundational <br>year are demanding. They're designed to challenge you and help you grow. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    60% of applicants do not complete the selection process. 50% of those who join <br>do not continue after the first year due to cultural, technical, or method <br>-ological differences. We're selecting for people who can navigate ambiguity, <br>exercise judgment on hard problems, and thrive in an environment where the an <br>-swer isn't always clear.
